Code Commander
==============

This is a simple webapp that allows a young learner to begin practicing programming.

The application takes the form of a game in which the user attempts to program a 
tank to move to and blow up a building.

It is based on jQuery, Crafty, and HTML5, and thus requires a fairly modern (ie non-IE) browser.
